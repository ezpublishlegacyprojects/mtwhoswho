	edit this content, an icon called "Identify people" appears. Click on it. 

	1.2 - The previous icon disappears and two new icons appear. The first one is
	"Save" and is used to save your modifications. The second one is "Cancel" and refreshes
	the page without saving anything.

	1.3 - Hover the picture and the cursor change to a small blue cross. It means that you
	can click on the picture to tag someone. Click somewhere.

	1.4 - A box appear with the list of people that you can identify. The list is either
	on the left or on the right depending on the side of the picture you have clicked in.
	The list is filled with all the available people minus all those that you have already
	tagged.

	1.5 - Select someone in the list. Once selected this person will be highlighted. If you
	click on someone or else if you click again on this person, this person is deselected.

	1.6 - At the bottom of the box, there are two buttons : "OK" and "Cancel". The first one
	allows you to validate your choice and the other one to cancel it. If you cancel your
	choice, your choice is cancelled and nobody is tagged. If you validate your
	choice, the name of the person appears under the picture in a little blue box and
	his/her name is removed from the choice list.
